Recommeded and Non recommended approaches in Pyhton 


Recommended:
	
	1.import xyz
	2. check if the package you are importing has any other function calling outside of the __main__. in this case we need to check if the function is harmful or not


Not-Recommended:

	1.from xyz import *  (because the * will import ann the variables, functions and everything)
