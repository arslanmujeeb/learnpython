Python Virtul environments handout. following commands are for mac and linux as i am using mac rn


Python virtual env is helpful for creating a separate env w.r.t our requirements. we can make as many virtual envs as we want.

it is created by the following connad link on the terminal

 Python3 -m venv path_of_the_directory_nameOfTheVirEnv

To activate the virtual env our systems we need to type the following command after the creation of virtual env 
	
	source path_of_the_directory_nameOfTheVirEnv/bin/acticate

following command can stop the venv we are working in and move back to Global env 

	deactivate

imagine i want to export all the packages present in the venv to a text format then we have to use the following command 

	pip freeze >  requirenmets.txt

Then i want to install all the packages in the requirements.txt in my new vnv then we need to run the following command

	pip install -r requirements.txt
